# `enkanomiya`
> Enkanomiya (Japanese: 淵えん下か宮のみや "Abyssal Depths Palace"), originally known as Byakuya no Kuni (Japanese: 白夜国 "Land of the White Night, Midnight Sun"), is a location near Sangonomiya Shrine. It can be entered via a deep pool, and legend has it that the Watatsumi people originated from here.

## Development shit

Depending on what you want to do, here's the commands you'll want to run:

|Action               |Command             |
|---------------------|--------------------|
|Install dependencies | `npm i`            |
|Run dev server       | `npm run dev` [1]  |
|Build for production | `npm run build`    |
|Run linter           | `npm run lint`     |

Contributions are welcome, although I am confident this project will not need many, if at all.

[1] you can also use the `serve` script, but i much prefer using `dev` myself lol
