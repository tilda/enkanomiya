            This is <b>enkanomiya</b>, an online toolset for the game <a href="https://genshin.mihoyo.com">Genshin Impact</a>.
            <br/>It intends to be a useful toolset, filling in for things that other sites have not implemented.
            <br/>Currently there are a couple of tools implemented, with more possibly coming in the future.
            <hr/><b>"Why would you make this?"</b> Projects are fun, and I wanted to practice webdev.
            <br/><b>"What's the name from?"</b> <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Enkanomiya">A reference to Genshin itself</a>, I thought it was cool.
            <br/><b>"Where did the CV formula come from?"</b> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/o5xuc4/simple_infographic_about_critical_value/">The formula was originally created by Abell.</a>

            <hr/><a href="https://github.com/tilda/enkanomiya">This tool is open source.</a>
